If you're reading this, then you've caught me while
I'm in the middle of migrating my blog from my old
Django site to a static site generated via Jekyll.

Be sure to check back later,

{% highlight rust %}
fn main() {
  println!("This is a test of the syntax hightlighting.");
}
{% endhighlight %}

Thanks
